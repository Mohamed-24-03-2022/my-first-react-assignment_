# my-first-react-assignment

This assignment is meant to build a simple React application with two components, App and Overview, that renders an input field and a submit button, and allows users to add tasks to a list. The list of tasks is managed in state using a class component, and for each task in the tasks array, an HTML list element is rendered.

The application should be able to handle input fields and forms in React, using event handlers and state, it should also able to render lists, manage state/props in class components and delete/edit items from a list.

The assignment provides both a "do-it-yourself guide" and a "detailed guide" for implementation, i did it all myself x) (by using google and documentations of course).
